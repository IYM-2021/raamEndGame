Please dont change this structure..............

Src will be our root or whatever.....

    Components folder will contain all the components. In react the pages are called component. 
    
        1st Component is Mapbox component. Everything Mapbox will render will be coded here (** matrics) aka widget 0
        
            2nd Component is Core Temp + Skin Temp (Graph).  aka widget 1
            
                3rd Component is HR + BR aka widget 2
                
                    and so on...


                    We will chose the components we want and call them in the fanexperience page aand 
                    dashboard page respectively.

                    Customization is in the Stylesheet.css in src/Assets 
                    And grid position customization is in the fanexperience.js (col,row)
